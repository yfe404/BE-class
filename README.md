# Introduction
Welcome to `BE-class_02: shellcode`!

In this guided coding session, youâ€™ll complete tasks step by step, with automated grading and instant feedback.
- Youâ€™ll see one task at a time in your `README.md`. Once you pass the current task, the README automatically updates to show you the next one.
- After uploading your solution, `ðŸŒ€ batidora` will test your code. This usually takes less than a minute.
- Be sure to place your files in the correct `uploads/` directory as instructed for each exercise.
- If a task isnâ€™t passed, youâ€™ll see a `failed` status and can try again until you succeed.

# Entry point
To start the class, you have to create your own repository based on this template:

1. Above the file list, click `Use this template`.
2. Select `Create a new repository`.
3. Type a name for your repository and choose a `Public` visibility.

Then, create a folder called `uploads` in the root of this repository and commit an empty file named `start` inside it. Wait for `ðŸŒ€ batidora` to prepare the class, then return to README.
